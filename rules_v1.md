5. **Europa - The Ocean's Keeper:**
    * **Challenges:** Intense radiation from Jupiter, thick icy crust, and deep-sea exploration.
    * **Unique Events:** Drill through the ice to explore the subsurface ocean, study its potential for harboring life, and navigate its challenging terrain.
    * **Lore:** Europa, with its icy exterior and subsurface ocean, offers the promise of discoveries that could reshape our understanding of life beyond Earth.

**Starting Resources:** Each team begins with 20 skill points and 40 resource points.

**Game Paths:** Each celestial body has its unique path filled with challenges and opportunities. Navigate wisely!


**Event Types:**
- **Opportunity To Learn [BLUE]:** Gain knowledge and skills to aid your mission.
- **Resource Loss [RED]:** Face challenges that might deplete your resources.
- **Resource Gain [GREEN]:** Discover opportunities to boost your resources.
- **Unavoidable [YELLOW]:** Events that every player must face and cannot bypass.
- **Black Events:** Major challenges that significantly impact your mission and make it return to Earth.


**The S.P.A.C.E Skill System:**
   * **S**cience: Solve scientific tasks and develop new technologies.
   * **P**roblem Solving: Address interpersonal and unexpected challenges.
   * **A**daptability: Adjust to new environments and situations.
   * **C**uriosity: Explore and discover new opportunities.
   * **E**ngineering: Build, repair, and innovate solutions.

**Resource Points:** Essential for your journey. Use them wisely to overcome challenges and seize opportunities.

**How the Game is Played**

1. **Starting the Game:**
    * Players sit around the game board and decide on their celestial path. The player choosing Mars or the one closest to Mars in a clockwise direction begins the game.
    * Players then take turns in a clockwise order, ensuring a structured flow of the game.

2. **Dice Roll Movement:**
    * At the start of each player's turn, they roll a single six-sided dice to determine the number of spaces they move forward on their chosen celestial path.
    * Players move their game piece according to the number rolled, landing on various event spaces that present challenges or opportunities.

3. **Navigating Yellow Events:**
    * Yellow events, marked as "Unavoidable," present significant challenges that players must face.
    * If a player's skill level is insufficient to overcome a yellow event, they cannot bypass it. Instead, they must retreat and retrace their steps on the game path.
    * Retreating allows players to re-encounter previous events, providing opportunities to gain additional skill points and better prepare for the yellow event challenge.
    * Once players feel they have sufficiently increased their skills, they can attempt to tackle the yellow event again on their next approach.

4. **Skill Level Advancement:**
    * As players navigate the game path and face various challenges, they earn skill points that increase their proficiency in the five S.P.A.C.E skills.
    * Each skill can be leveled up to a maximum of 10 points.
    * If a player reaches the maximum level (10 points) in a particular skill and subsequently earns an additional point in that skill, they have the flexibility to assign that extra point to any other skill of their choice. This represents the transferability of knowledge and the adaptability of astronauts in space missions.

**End Goal:** Establish a thriving colony that stands as a testament to human ingenuity and adaptability.

**Game End:** The game concludes when all teams have either established their colonies or faced insurmountable challenges.
